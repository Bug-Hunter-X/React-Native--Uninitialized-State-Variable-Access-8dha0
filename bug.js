This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This often happens in the component's render method, before the component has had a chance to mount and set its initial state.

```javascript
// Incorrect code
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count + 1}</Text>  {/* Error here: count might be undefined */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

React Native, like React, is asynchronous. State updates don't happen immediately after calling `setCount`. So the above code can try to increment `count` before it has a defined value, leading to an error.
